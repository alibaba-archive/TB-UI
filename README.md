## Teambition UI System
A pithy and realistic way to combine design and code. The all-in-one UIS actually is flexible, it can not only improve efficiency with the unified design, but also make program more lightweight.

## Composition
Why do we call it "system", but not "collection"?

Because it has a natural and intuitive composition that organizes assets and libraries.

There is a list of all matters below:

### Atoms
- [TB-Icons](https://github.com/teambition/TB-Icons)
- [TB-Colors](https://github.com/teambition/TB-Colors)

### Molecules
- [TB-Styles](https://github.com/teambition/TB-Styles)
- [TB-MStyles](https://github.com/teambition/TB-MStyles) [Todo]

### Materials
- [TB-UIKit](https://github.com/teambition/TB-UIKit) **[WIP]**
- [TB-MUIKit](https://github.com/teambition/TB-MUIKit) [Todo]

### Goods
- [TB-MViews](https://github.com/teambition/TB-MViews) [Todo]

### Mediums
- [TB-Linter](https://github.com/teambition/TB-Linter)
- [Teambition Standards](https://github.com/teambition/standard)

## Benefits
Literally, you can't directly use the matters which are not the general style in your non-tb project after installing them with NPM.

We really hope that you get very inspired by our experiences and save some time for your next amazing project.
