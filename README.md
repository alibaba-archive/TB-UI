## Teambition UI System
A pithy and realistic way to combine design and code.

## Composition
Why do we called it "system", but not "collection"?

Because it has a natural and intuitive composition that organizes assets and libraries.

There is a list of all matters below:

### Atoms
- [TB-Icons](https://github.com/teambition/TB-Icons)
- [TB-Colors](https://github.com/teambition/TB-Colors)

### Molecules
- [TB-Styles](https://github.com/teambition/TB-Styles) [Paused]
- [TB-MStyles](https://github.com/teambition/TB-MStyles) **[WIP]**

### Materials
- [TB-Styles-React](https://github.com/teambition/TB-Styles-React) [Todo]
- [TB-MStyles-Vue](https://github.com/teambition/TB-MStyles-Vue) [Todo]

### Mediums
- [TB-Linter](https://github.com/teambition/TB-Linter)
- [Teambition Standards](https://github.com/teambition/standard)

## Benefits
Literally, you can't directly use the matters which are not general style in your non-tb project after installing them with NPM.

We really hope that you get very inspired by our experiences and save some time for you next amazing project.
